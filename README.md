# Convenience_store

This workbook creates a convenience store classification for convenience stores in London. The purpose is an attempt to replicate the anlysis performed by [Hood et al, (2016)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09593969.2015.1086403) but to do so for London. Data sources used for this can be found through links in the notebook itself.

The dataset for stores across the UK for major grocery retailers comes from [Geolytix](https://geolytix.com/)
